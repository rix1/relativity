      What exactly is a <i>lifetime</i>, and what is the most appropriate way to
      think about <i>life</i> in relation to <i>time</i>? My bold claim is that
      most people think about this the wrong way - let me explain.

When my sister got her first son in 2016 I joked with her: <i>What is it like
waking up having never gone to sleep?</i> A seemingly silly question that is
easy to ask, but very hard to make any sense of. Similarly, in a funeral we
might think: <i>What is it like going to sleep, never to wake up again?</i>
These two questions sets the boundaries for what we call life. Birth, a past
experience no one remember, and death, a future experience we're experientially
blind to.

The keywords here are <i>past</i> and <i>future</i>. Baked into the language
of how we commonly talk about birth and death, lies the notion that the two
concepts can be fixed on a timeline. This time period consitutes a lifetime
for us human beings. It can be visualized as a line with three points (Birth,
Present, and Death) which appropriately map to past, present and future.

This is a pretty nice mental modal. It's easy and straight forward. It
especially favours young people which seem to have most of their life in front
of them. Using this model we can calculate lifetime as the distance between
Birth and Death. Normal people call this distance <i>age</i>.

However simple, I belive that using <i>age</i> as a value to denote a lifetime
is incorrect. During my time as a university student back in 2012, I realized
this by looking at the phrase

> "You got most of your life in front of you"

If you think about it, no part of your life is in front of you. I believe that
we are the sum of our <i>past</i> experiences and <i>present</i> sensations,
but the <i>future</i> hasn't happened yet, so how can most of your life be
there? This seemed very strange to me.

  I recently read Lisa Feldman's book "How Emotions are Made". She made me
  realize that humans are special in the way we predict and anticipate future
  experiences, and that this is actually a critical part of how we craft our own
  reality. In that sense, I guess a little bit of the future is part of your
  life, but it's miniscule compared to everything that has ever happened to you.

I get what you're thinking: <i>"This is overly pedantic and also very pessimistic â€“ the phrase is just a
positive way of saying most of your life hasn't happened yet"</i>
. You might be right. But when I challenged it, something very strange happened.
I started to realize that we could treat the concept of a lifetime as something more
than a mere value. A variable of equal length independent of who's viewpoint you
take. Previously, this wasn't as clear to me.

Let's say you're <InlineInput /> years old.

In this post I'll outline how think about the concept of a lifetime and
explore some tools to make it easier to reason about.

  1: which is really hard to answer because we don't remember the experience of
  waking up.
  <br />
  2: which is equally hard to answer because we have never experienced death
  ourselves.

  That being said, I think I have a better understanding of after reading "I Am
  a Strange Loop" from Douglas Hofstadter and "How Emotions Are Made" by Lisa
  Feldman Barrett. Worth checking out if you're into that thing.

This relates to birth like the following question relates to death: "What is
it like to go to sleep and never wake up again?".

These are big questions, along the lines of "What's the purpose of it all?",
and they have been pondering people for ages. But as with many questions, they
might not be the right ones to be asked. And asking the wrong questions might
cause a lot of harm
