      What exactly is a lifetime, and what is the most appropriate way to think
      about life in relation to time? For a long time I've gotten it wrong. I

  Life can be fairly straight forward. It starts when you're born, then
  hopefully a lot of time passes before you cease to exist, at which point
  you're dead. For a very long time this was the way I thought about life. I
  viewed own lifetime as a line with three points. Birth, Now, and Death. These
  points map appropriately to the <em>past, present and future</em>. Unless
  you're a physiscist like{' '}

  this is probably how you yoo think about your life:

  This is a pretty nice mental modal. It's easy and straight forward. It
  especially favours young people which seem to have their whole life in front
  of them. But I believe this is incorrect. Back in ~2012 (don't remember
  exactly the date), I realized that saying
</P>

<Quote fontSize="f3 i tc">"You got most of your life in front of you"</Quote>

<P>
  gets it completely the wrong. If you think about it, no part of your life is
  in front of you. Given that we are the sum of our <em>past</em> experiences
  and <em>present</em> sensations and that the future hasn't happened yet, how
  can "most of your life" be there? This seemed very strange to me.

    [Side note] I recently read Lisa Feldman's book "How Emotions are Made". She
    made me realize that humans are special in the way we predict and anticipate
    future experiences, and that this is actually a critical part of how we
    craft our own reality. In that sense, I guess a little bit of the future is
    part of your life, but it's miniscule compared to everything that has ever
    happened to you.

  You might think this is overly pedantic â€“ the phrase is just a way of saying{' '}
  <em>"most of your life hasn't happened yet"</em>, right? Well, you might be
  right. But when I challenged this, something very strange happened. I started
  to realize that we could treat a lifetime as a variable. A variable of equal
  length independent of who's viewpoint you take. Previously, this wasn't as
  clear to me.
